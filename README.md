Userscript to block book meals via ChCh booking system

Step 1: add Chrome extension [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)  
Step 2: install the following two userscripts: [Execute Script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445159-execute-script) & [Book Hall](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445176-book-hall)

How to use: Right click anywhere in Chrome, hover mouse over "Tampermonkey", and click "Book Hall". Tah-dah. *Note: Any previously open tabs must be reloaded since userscript was added in order to work!*  
  
Also, buttons have been added to the bottom of the block book page itself if you prefer seeing what goes on.
